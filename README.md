# Causality
This repository provides implemented algorithms for causal inference between two variables and learning causal structures in graphs. All code is written in Python 3, using SciPy, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Hyppo, and NetworkX. Jupyter notebooks are provided to show analyses.

**Note**: These are implemented algorithms and study for assignments of [Causal Inference](http://sina.sharif.ir/~saleh/CI.pdf) taught by Prof. Salehkalyebar in Fall 2020. *This repository is in its early phases*.
